The Blinky-Buzzy Toy plays the Wii Theme Music. In order to play the song,
simply press the first switch on the bottom board (S1). This will trigger the
song to play and also change the LED lights from red to green. Red signifies
that no note/music is playing and green signifies that a note is currently playing.
